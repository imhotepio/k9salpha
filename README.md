From the creator of K9s, here comes the next generation of k9s utilities.

K9s provides a terminal UI to interact with your Kubernetes clusters.
The aim of this project is to make it easier to navigate, observe and manage
your applications in the wild. K9s continually watches Kubernetes
for changes and offers subsequent commands to interact with your observed resources.
