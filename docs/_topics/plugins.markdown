# Plugins

K9sùû™ allows you to extend your command line and tooling by defining your very own cluster commands via plugins. Plugins are defined a file named `$HOME/.k9s-alpha/plugin.yml`.

A plugin is defined as follows:

* Shortcut option represents the key combination a user would type to activate the plugin
* Description will be printed next to the shortcut in the K9sùû™menu
* Scopes defines a collection of resources name/short-name for the views associated with the plugin. You can specify `all` to provide this shortcut for all views.
* Command represents ad-hoc commands the plugin runs upon activation
* Background specifies whether or not the command runs in the background
* Args specifies the various arguments that should apply to the command above

K9sùû™ does provide additional environment variables for you to customize your plugins arguments. Currently, the available environment variables are as follows:

* `$NAMESPACE` -- the selected resource namespace
* `$NAME` -- the selected resource name
* `$CONTAINER` -- the current container if applicable
* `$FILTER` -- the current filter if any
* `$KUBECONFIG` -- the KubeConfig location.
* `$CLUSTER` the active cluster name
* `$CONTEXT` the active context name
* `$USER` the active user
* `$GROUPS` the active groups
* `$POD` while in a container view
* `$COL-<RESOURCE_COLUMN_NAME>` use a given column name for a viewed resource. Must be prefixed by `COL-`!

NOTE: Take a look at some of the [Community Custom Plugins](https://github.com/imhotepio/k9salpha/plugins) contributed by your K9sers friends.
