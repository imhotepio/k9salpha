# Scans

New! In K9sùû™ when workloads are detected, resources associated with the workload will be scans to report potential issues or anomalies. Although, we always recommend wide open scans to avoid potential hidden issues, one may want to exclude certain resources from the scans are they may not be either pertinent to the workload or may come from other subsystems. For example , you may have valid arguments for not specifying probes or not wanting to report on istio sidecars. For this reason, you can further qualify scans exclusions in a context specific file `$HOME/,k9salpha/contexts/contextA/scans.yml`.
